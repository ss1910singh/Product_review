# Product Review Extension

## Overview

The **Product Review Extension** is a browser extension designed to enhance the user experience when reading reviews on e-commerce platforms. It analyzes product reviews and helps users identify potentially fake or misleading reviews using machine learning techniques. By providing key insights, the extension aids in making more informed purchasing decisions.

## Features

- **Fake Review Detection**: Identifies and flags potentially fake reviews using advanced natural language processing (NLP) models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Provides a sentiment breakdown of reviews, helping users understand the overall feedback.
- **Review Summarization**: Offers concise summaries of lengthy reviews for quick assessment.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly into the product pages of popular e-commerce websites.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python (for backend model training)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - Frontend: React.js
  - Backend: Flask (API for ML model)
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow
- **Data Sources**: Public datasets containing product reviews for training the model, including both genuine and fake reviews.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-review-extension.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd product-review-extension
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # For frontend
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For backend
   ```

4. Build and run the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Load the extension into your browser:
   - Go to your browser’s extension settings.
   - Enable “Developer Mode.”
   - Load the `build/` directory as an unpacked extension.

6. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Once installed, the extension automatically activates when browsing supported e-commerce platforms.
- Reviews will be scanned in real-time, and the extension will highlight flagged reviews with an indicator.
- Users can click the extension icon for more detailed insights, including sentiment analysis, fake review probability, and a summary.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: We collect product reviews from various sources and label them as fake or genuine.
2. **Model Training**: Using a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), the model learns to differentiate between fake and genuine reviews.
3. **Real-time Analysis**: When a user visits a product page, the extension sends the reviews to the backend, which processes them and returns insights to be displayed on the UI.
4. **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the extension to view detailed analysis and take actions based on flagged reviews.

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified reviews (fake vs genuine).
- **Precision**: The proportion of flagged reviews that are truly fake.
- **Recall**: The proportion of fake reviews that were correctly flagged.
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
  
Current model performance (based on validation data):
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 90%
- **Recall**: 85%
- **F1-Score**: 87%

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support**: Extend the extension to analyze reviews written in languages other than English.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Make the extension compatible with additional browsers (Safari, Firefox).
- **Review Source Detection**: Automatically detect and adapt to various e-commerce platforms.
